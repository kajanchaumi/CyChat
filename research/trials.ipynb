For most people, there are three key dangers \\nto be aware of: malware, hackers and identity theft.\\nMalware (malicious software) is created with the \\nintention of accessing your computer and gathering \\ninformation, usually for the purpose of selling to other \\ninterested parties. The most commonly known type  \\nof malware is a virus (and the two terms are often used \\ninterchangeably) but others include spyware, adware, \\nworms and Trojan horses. Malware can do a variety  \\nof things, including:\\nSpying on your activity (spyware)\\nLetting someone remotely control your computer\\nActively damage your files and computer \\nSpread infection to other files and computers \\n(virus, worm)\\nForce you to watch ads (adware).\\nYou’ll nearly always get malware by running an infected \\nprogram. The program itself will probably work exactly \\nas normal; it just secretly installs a virus, spyware  \\nor adware when it’s run.\\nThat’s how the malware writers grab you: they take \\na program that’s appealing to you and slip a virus, \\nspyware or adware into it. That’s why they are often \\ncalled Trojan horses. \\nThis is why you need to be careful about which \\nprograms you download and run on your computer.  \\nIf you download a program from a disreputable  \\nsource, it may be infected.'),\n",

But there are automated \\nprograms called bots that might try and test your \\ncomputer’s defences.\\nEven these are vanishingly rare now, since most \\ncomputers have excellent defences against virtual \\nintruders. It’s highly unlikely that your computer  \\nis vulnerable out of the box unless it is very, very old.\\nWhat a hacker (or bot) does is try to exploit a vulnerability \\nin your computer’s security configuration.\\nAs an example, do you know about Windows file \\nsharing?

In this case, the victim \\nreceives an email that looks like and purports to be from their bank. It often  \\nhas some dire warning about their finances, and says they need to log on to  \\ntheir online banking service in order to fix it. A web link is embedded in the email.\\nThe link does not lead to the real bank’s site, however, but to another site that’s \\nmade to look exactly like that of the real bank. The person would only know \\nif they looked at the web address in the browser Address bar. Then, when the \\nvictim logs in, their net banking password is harvested by the scammer.'),\n",

If somebody outside tries to talk to your \\ncomputer without authorisation, they can’t.  \\nIf a program on your computer tries to talk  \\nto the internet, it will either be stopped, allowed, \\nor a popup will appear asking you if you’d like to  \\nlet the program communicate with the internet.  \\nOn a Windows PC, the popup will look like this: \\nYour computer comes with a firewall built in. \\nA firewall blocks access \\nto your computer\\nPROTECTING  \\nYOUR COMPUTER'),\n",

Even \\na free anti-virus program improves the security of your \\ncomputer dramatically.\\nBut that’s not the whole solution: security software \\ncan’t protect you from con artists and tricksters.  \\nThere are, however, five simple things you can  \\ndo to keep yourself safe:\\n1. Don’t post personal information on public sites\\nLots of sites would like you to give them your personal \\ninformation: name, date of birth, address, email \\naddress and so on. In some cases, such as shopping \\nsites, it’s necessary and legitimate. On others, like \\nFacebook, you don’t need to (and should not) provide \\nprivate information. It can be used to track and scam \\nyou.\\n2. Don’t open email attachments unless you’re really sure\\nOne of the most common sources of malware \\ninfections is email attachments.\\nEmail attachments are files that come with emails on \\nyour computer.\\nIf you remember what we said earlier about  \\nyou needing to run a program to get infected with \\nmalware, this is how you often get trapped: an email \\nwill come in with a program attached and some kind \\nof exhortation to run it, like Run this program, it’s \\nawesome!\\nThese can even come from people you know and trust. \\nThey might send you the malware not knowing it’s \\nadware or spyware, and there is virus malware which \\ncan actually hijack the email of infected computers \\nand send out copies of themselves to everybody in the \\ninfected person’s address book.\\nThe short of it is, if you’re not sure, don’t open the \\nattachment.\\nThat’s not to say don’t use email attachments  \\nat all.

If it has a \\nbad reputation, a Google search will likely reveal it.\\nServices like PayPal allow you to buy things without \\ngiving up credit card details to a store. We cover that \\nmore in our Online Shopping and Banking workshops.\\n5. Don’t install programs from untrustworthy sources\\nMalware generally comes attached to other \\n(legitimate-looking) programs.\\nWhen you download a program from a shady \\nsource, which can include popular peer-to-peer \\ndownload sites such as BitTorrent, you run the risk of \\ndownloading malware.\\nHow do you know if a site or program is shady?

It uses malicious code to \\nalter computer code, logic or data and le ad to cybercrimes, such as information and identity \\ntheft. \\nCyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories: \\n1) Web-based attacks \\n2) System-based attacks \\nWeb-based attacks \\nThese are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of t he important \\nweb-based attacks are as follows- \\n1. Injection attacks \\nIt is the attack in which some data will be injected into a web application to manipulate the \\napplication and fetch the required information. \\nExample- SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection etc. \\n2. DNS Spoofing \\nDNS Spoofing is a type of computer security hacking. Whereby a data is introduced into a \\nDNS resolver's cache causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting \\ntraffic to the attackers  computer or any other computer. The DNS spoofing attacks can go on \\nfor a long period of time without being detected and can cause serious security issues. \\n3. Session Hijacking \\nIt is a security attack on a user session over a protected network. Web applications cr eate \\ncookies to store the state and user sessions. By stealing the cookies, an attacker can have \\naccess to all of the user data. \\n4. Phishing \\nPhishing is a type of attack which attempts to steal sensitive information like user login \\ncredentials and credit c ard number. It occurs when an attacker is masquerading as a \\ntrustworthy entity in electronic communication. \\n5. Brute force \\nIt is a type of attack which uses a trial and error method. This attack generates a large number \\nof guesses and validates them to obt ain actual data like user password and personal \\nidentification number. This attack may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by \\nsecurity, analysts to test an organization's network security.\"),\n",

Denial of Service \\nIt is an attack which meant to m ake a server or network resource unavailable to the users. It \\naccomplishes this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a \\ncrash. It uses the single system and single internet connection to attack a server. It can be \\nclassified into the following- \\nVolume-based attacks - Its goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and is \\nmeasured in bit per second. \\nProtocol attacks- It consumes actual server resources, and is measured in a packet. \\nApplication layer attacks- Its goal is to crash the web server and is measured in request per \\nsecond. \\n7. Dictionary attacks \\nThis type of attack stored the list of a commonly used password and validated them to get \\noriginal password. \\n8. URL Interpretation \\nIt is a type of attack where we can change the certain parts of a URL, and one can make a \\nweb server to deliver web pages for which he is not authorized to browse. \\n9. File Inclusion attacks \\nIt is a type of attack that allows an attacker to access unauthorized or essential files which is \\navailable on the web server or to execute malicious files on the web server by making use of \\nthe include functionality. \\n10. Man in the middle attacks \\nIt is a type of attack that allows an attacker to intercepts the connection between client and \\nserver and acts as a bridge between them. Due to this, an attacker will be able to read, insert \\nand modify the data in the intercepted connection. \\nSystem-based attacks \\nThese are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. \\nSome of the important system-based attacks are as follows- \\n1. Virus \\nIt is a type of malicious software program that spread throughout the computer files without \\nthe knowledge of a user. It is a self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates by \\ninserting copies of itself into other computer programs when executed. It can also execute \\ninstructions that cause harm to the system.'),\n",

Worm \\nIt is a type of malware whose primary function is to replicate itself to spread to uninfected \\ncomputers. It works same  as the computer virus. Worms often originate from email \\nattachments that appear to be from trusted senders. \\n3. Trojan horse \\nIt is a malicious program that occurs unexpected changes to computer setting and unusual \\nactivity, even when the computer should be  idle. It misleads the user of its true intent. It \\nappears to be a normal application but when opened/executed some malicious code will run \\nin the background. \\n4. Backdoors \\nIt is a method that bypasses the normal authentication process. A developer may crea te a \\nbackdoor so that an application or operating system can be accessed for troubleshooting or \\nother purposes. \\n5.

As shown in Figure, operational cyber security risks arise from \\nthree types of actions: i) inadvertent actions (generally by insiders) that are taken without \\nmalicious or harmful intent; ii) deliberate actions (by insiders or outsiders) that are taken \\nintentionally and are meant to do harm; and iii) inaction (generally by insiders), such as a \\nfailure to act in a given situation, either because of a lack of appropriate skills, knowledge, \\nguidance, or avai lability of the correct person to take action Of primary concern here are \\ndeliberate actions, of which there are three categories of motivation. \\n1. Political motivations: examples include destroying, disrupting, or taking control of \\ntargets; espionage; and making political statements, protests, or retaliatory actions. \\n2. Economic motivations: examples include theft of intellectual property or other \\neconomically valuable assets (e.g., funds, credit card information); fraud; industrial \\nespionage and sabotage; and blackmail. \\n3. Socio-cultural motivations: examples include attacks with philosophical, theological, \\npolitical, and even humanitarian goals.

A masquerade may be \\nattempted through the use of stolen login IDs and passwords, through finding security gaps in \\nprograms or through bypassing the authentication mechanism. \\nSession replay: In this type of attack, a hack er steals an authorized user’s log in information \\nby stealing the session ID. The intruder gains access and the ability to do anything the \\nauthorized user can do on the website. \\nMessage modification: In this attack, an intruder alters packet header address es to direct a \\nmessage to a different destination or modify the data on a target machine. \\nIn a denial of service  (DoS) attack, users are deprived of access to a network or web  \\nresource. This is generally accomplished by overwhelming the target with more traffic than it \\ncan handle. \\nIn a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) exploit, large numbers of compromised systems \\n(sometimes called a botnet or zombie army) attack a single target. \\nPassive Attacks: Passive attacks are relatively scarce from a classification perspective, but \\ncan be carried out with relative ease, particularly if the traffic is not encrypted. \\n \\nTypes of Passive attacks: \\nEavesdropping (tapping): the attacker simply listens to messages exchanged by two entities. \\nFor the attack to be useful, the traffic must not be encrypted. Any unencrypted information, \\nsuch as a password sent in response to an HTTP request, may be retrieved by the attacker. \\n \\nTraffic analysis: the attacker looks at the metadata transmitted in traffic in order to deduce \\ninformation relating to the exchange and the participating entities, e.g. the form of the \\nexchanged traffic (rate, duration, etc.). In the cases where  encrypted data  are used, traffic \\nanalysis can also lead to attacks by  cryptanalysis, whereby the attacker may obtain \\ninformation or succeed in unencrypting the traffic. \\nSoftware Attacks: Malicious code (sometimes called malware) is a type of software \\ndesigned to take over or damage a computer user's operating system, without the user's \\nknowledge or approval. It can be very difficult to remove and very damaging. Common \\nmalware examples are listed in the following table:\"),\n",

The owner can fully claim compensation for the entire damage in such cases. \\nSection 66 - Applicable in case a person is found to dishonestly or fraudulently committing \\nany act referred to in section 43. The imprisonment term in such instances can mount up to \\nthree years or a fine of up to Rs. 5 lakh.  \\nSection 66B - Incorporates the punishments for fraudulently receiving stolen communication \\ndevices or computers, which confirms a probable three years imprisonment. This term can \\nalso be topped by Rs. 1 lakh fine, depending upon the severity.  \\nSection 66C  - This section scrutinizes the identity thefts rela ted to imposter digital \\nsignatures, hacking passwords, or other distinctive identification features.

This process can involve \\nanything from breaking encryption, to executing search warrants with a law enforcement \\nteam, to recovering and analyzing files from hard drives that will be  critical evidence in the \\nmost serious civil and criminal cases. \\n \\nThe forensic examination of computers, and data storage media, is a complicated and highly \\nspecialized process. The results of forensic examinations are compiled and included in \\nreports. In many cases, examiners testify to their findings, where their skills and abilities are \\nput to ultimate scrutiny. \\n \\nDIGITAL FORENSICS: \\nDigital Forensics is defined as the process of preservation, identification, extraction, and \\ndocumentation of computer evidence which can be used by the court of law. It is a science of \\nfinding evidence from digital media like a computer, mobile phone, server, or network. It \\nprovides the forensic team with the best techniques and tools to solve complicated digital -\\nrelated cases. \\nDigital Forensics helps the forensic team to analyzes, inspect, identifies, and preserve the \\ndigital evidence residing on various types of electronic devices. \\nDigital forensic science is a branch of forensic science that focuses on the recovery and \\ninvestigation of material found in digital devices related to cybercrime. \\nTHE NEED FOR COMPUTER FORENSICS \\nComputer forensics is also important because it can save your organization money. ... From a \\ntechnical standpoint, the main goal of  computer forensics is to identify, collect, preserve, and \\nanalyze data in a way that preserves the integrity of the evidence collected so it can be used \\neffectively in a legal case. \\nCYBER FORENSICS AND DIGITAL EVIDENCE: \\nDigital evidence is information stored or transmitted in bi nary form that may be relied on in \\ncourt. It can be found on a computer hard drive, a mobile phone, among other places. Digital \\nevidence is commonly associated with electronic crime, or e -crime, such as child \\npornography or credit card fraud. However, digi tal evidence is now used to prosecute all \\ntypes of crimes, not just e -crime. For example, suspects' e -mail or mobile phone files might \\ncontain critical evidence regarding their intent, their whereabouts at the time of a crime and \\ntheir relationship with other suspects. In 2005, for example, a floppy disk led investigators to \\nthe BTK serial killer who had eluded police capture since 1974 and claimed the lives of at \\nleast 10 victims.\"),\n",

Law enforcement agencies are \\nchallenged by the need to train officers to collect digital evi dence and keep up with rapidly \\nevolving technologies such as computer operating systems. \\n \\n \\nFORENSICS ANALYSIS OF EMAIL: \\nE-mail forensics refers to the study of source and content of e-mail as evidence to identify the \\nactual sender and recipient of a messag e, data/time of transmission, detailed record of e -mail \\ntransaction, intent of the sender, etc. This study involves investigation of metadata, keyword \\nsearching, port scanning, etc. for authorship attribution and identification of e-mail scams. \\nVarious approaches that are used for e-mail forensic are: \\n\\uf0b7 Header Analysis  – Meta data in the e -mail message in the form of control \\ninformation i.e. envelope and headers including headers in the message body contain \\ninformation about the sender and/or the path along w hich the message has traversed. \\nSome of these may be spoofed to conceal the identity of the sender. A detailed \\nanalysis of these headers and their correlation is performed in header analysis. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Bait Tactics – In bait tactic investigation an e -mail with http: “<imgsrc>” tag having \\nimage source at some computer monitored by the investigators is send to the sender of \\ne-mail under investigation containing real (genuine) e -mail address. When the e -mail \\nis opened, a log entry containing the IP address of the recip ient (sender of the e -mail \\nunder investigation) is recorded on the http server hosting the image and thus sender \\nis tracked. However, if the recipient (sender of the e-mail under investigation) is using \\na proxy server then IP address of the proxy server is  recorded. The log on proxy \\nserver can be used to track the sender of the e -mail under investigation. If the proxy \\nserver’s log is unavailable due to some reason, then investigators may send the tactic \\ne-mail containing a) Embedded Java Applet that runs on  receiver’s computer or b) \\nHTML page with Active X Object. Both aiming to extract IP address of the receiver’s \\ncomputer and e-mail it to the investigators. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Server Investigation – In this investigation, copies of delivered e -mails and server \\nlogs are investigated to identify source of an e-mail message. E-mails purged from the \\nclients (senders or receivers) whose recovery is impossible may be requested from \\nservers (Proxy or ISP) as most of them store a copy of all e -mails after their \\ndeliveries. Further, l ogs maintained by servers can be studied to trace the address of \\nthe computer responsible for making the e -mail transaction. However, servers store \\nthe copies of e -mail and server logs only for some limited periods and some may not \\nco-operate with the inve stigators. Further, SMTP servers which store data like credit \\ncard number and other data pertaining to owner of a mailbox can be used to identify \\nperson behind an e-mail address. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Network Device Investigation – In this form of e-mail investigation, logs maintained \\nby the network devices such as routers, firewalls and switches are used to investigate'),\n",

This form of investigation is complex and is used \\nonly when the logs of servers (Proxy or ISP) are unavailable due to some reas on, e.g. \\nwhen ISP or proxy does not maintain a log or lack of co -operation by ISP’s or failure \\nto maintain chain of evidence. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Software Embedded Identifiers  – Some information about the creator of e -mail, \\nattached files or documents may be included with th e message by the e-mail software \\nused by the sender for composing e -mail. This information may be included in the \\nform of custom headers or in the form of MIME content as a Transport Neutral \\nEncapsulation Format (TNEF). Investigating the e -mail for these d etails may reveal \\nsome vital information about the senders e -mail preferences and options that could \\nhelp client side evidence gathering. The investigation can reveal PST file names, \\nWindows logon username, MAC address, etc. of the client computer used to send e-\\nmail message. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Sender Mailer Fingerprints  – Identification of software handling e -mail at server \\ncan be revealed from the Received header field and identification of software \\nhandling e-mail at client can be ascertained by using different set of hea ders like “X-\\nMailer” or equivalent. These headers describe applications and their versions used at \\nthe clients to send e -mail. This information about the client computer of the sender \\ncan be used to help investigators devise an effective plan and thus prov e to be very \\nuseful. \\nEMAIL FORENSICS TOOLS \\nErasing or deleting an email doesn’t necessarily mean that it is gone forever. Often emails \\ncan be forensically extracted even after deletion. Forensic tracing of e -mail is similar to \\ntraditional detective work. It is used for retrieving information from mailbox files. \\n\\uf0b7 MiTec Mail Viewer  – This is a viewer for Outlook Express, Windows \\nMail/Windows Live Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird message databases, and single EML \\nfiles. It displays a list of contained messages with al l needed properties, like an \\nordinary e -mail client. Messages can be viewed in detailed view, including \\nattachments and an HTML preview. It has powerful searching and filtering capability \\nand also allows extracting email addresses from all emails in opened  folder to list by \\none click. Selected messages can be saved to eml files with or without their \\nattachments. Attachments can be extracted from selected messages by one command. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 OST and PST Viewer – Nucleus Technologies’ OST and PST viewer tools help you \\nview OST and PST files easily without connecting to an MS Exchange server. These \\ntools allow the user to scan OST and PST files and they display the data saved in it \\nincluding email messages, contacts, calendars, notes, etc., in a proper folder structure. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 eMailTrackerPro – eMailTrackerPro analyses the headers of an e -mail to detect the \\nIP address of the machine that sent the message so that the sender can be tracked \\ndown. It can trace multiple e -mails at the same time and easily keep track of them. \\nThe geog raphical location of an IP address is key information for determining the \\nthreat level or validity of an e-mail message.'),\n",

The foundation of forensics is using a \\nmethodical approach to reach appropriate conclusions based on the available data or \\ndetermine that no conclusion can yet be drawn.  \\nReporting: The process of preparing and presenting the information resulting from the \\nanalysis phase. Many factors affect reporting, including the following:  \\na. Alternative Explanations:When the information regarding an event is incomplete, it \\nmay not be possible to arrive at a definitive explanation of what happened. When an \\nevent has two or more plausible explanations, each should be given due consideration \\nin the reporting process.

Moreover, IP \\ndata world when compared to voice-centric security threats is new to mobile operators. There \\nare numerous attacks that can be committed against mobile networks and they can originate \\nfrom two primary vectors. One is from outside the mobile network - that is, public Internet, \\nprivate networks and other operator\\'s networks - and the other is within the mobile networks - \\nthat is, devices such as data -capable handsets and Smartphones, notebook computers or even \\ndesktop computers connected to the 3G network. \\nPopular types of attacks against 3G mobile networks are as follows: \\n1. Malwares, viruses and worms:  Although many users are still in the transient process of \\nswitching from  2G,2.5G2G,2.5G to 3G,3G, it is a growing need to educate the community \\npeople and provide awareness of such threats that exist while using mobile devices. Here are \\nfew examples of malware(s) specific to mobile devices: \\n\\uf0b7 Skull Trojan: I targets Series 60 phones equipped with the Symbian mobile OS. \\n\\uf0b7 Cabir Worm: It is the first dedicated mobile -phone worm infects phones running on \\nSymbian OS and scans other mobile devices to send a copy of itself to the first \\nvulnerable phone it finds through Bluetooth Wireless technology. The worst thing \\nabout this worm is that the source code for the Cabir -H and Cabir -I viruses is \\navailable online. \\n\\uf0b7 Mosquito Trojan:  It affects the Series 60 Smartphones and is a cracked version of \\n\"Mosquitos\" mobile phone game. \\n\\uf0b7 Brador Trojan: It affects the Windows CE OS by creating a svchost. exe file in the \\nWindows start-up folder which allows full control of the device. This executable file \\nis conductive to traditional worm propagation vector such as E-Mail file attachments. \\n\\uf0b7 Lasco Worm: It was released first in 2005 to target PDAs and mobile phones running \\nthe Symbian OS. Lasco is based on Cabir\\'s source code and replicates over Bluetooth \\nconnection. \\n2. Denial -of-service (DoS):  The main objective behind this attack is to make the system  \\nunavailable to the intended users. Virus attacks can be used to damage the system to make the \\nsystem unavailable. Presently, one of the most common cyber security threats to wired \\nInternet service providers (iSPs) is a distributed denial -of-service (DDos)  attack .DDoS'),\n",

Overbilling attack:  Overbilling involves an attacker hijacking a subscriber\\'s IP address \\nand then using it ( i.e., the connection) to initiate downloads that are not \"Free downloads\" or \\nsimply use it for his/her own purposes. In either case, the legitimate user is charged for the \\nactivity which the user did not conduct or authorize to conduct. \\n4. Spoofed policy d evelopment process (PDP):  These of attacks exploit the vulnerabilities \\nin the GTP [General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol]. \\n5. Signaling-level attacks: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol used \\nin IP multimedia subs ystem (IMS) networks to provide Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) \\nservices. There are several vulnerabilities with SIP-based VolP systems. \\nCredit Card Frauds in Mobile and Wireless Computing Era: \\nThese are new trends in cybercrime that are coming up with  mobile computing - mobile \\ncommerce (M -Commerce) and mobile banking (M -Banking). Credit card frauds are now \\nbecoming commonplace given the ever -increasing power and the ever -reducing prices of the \\nmobile hand-held devices, factors that result in easy avail ability of these gadgets to almost \\nanyone. Today belongs to \"mobile compüting,\" that is, anywhere anytime computing. The \\ndevelopments in wireless technology have fuelled this new mode of working for white collar \\nworkers. This is true for credit card proces sing too; wireless credit card processing is a \\nrelatively new service that will allow a person to process credit cards electronically, virtually \\nanywhere. Wireless credit card processing is a very desirable system, because it allows \\nbusinesses to process t ransactions from mobile locations quickly, efficiently and \\nprofessionally. It is most often used by businesses that operate mainly in a mobile \\nenvironment \\n \\nThere is a system available from an Australian company \"Alacrity\" called closed -loop \\nenvironment for for wireless (CLEW). Figure above shows the flow of events with CLEW \\nwhich is a registered trademark of Alacrity used here only to demonstrate the flow in this \\nenvironment. \\n \\nAs shown in Figure, the basic flow is as follows: \\n1.

Perceptions of the organizations to \\nthese cybersecurity challenges are important in devising appropriate security operating \\nprocedure. When people are asked about important in managing a diverse range of mobile \\ndevices, they seem to be thinking of the ones shown in below figure. \\nAs the numb er of mobile device users increases, two challenges are presented: one at the \\ndevice level called \"micro challenges\" and another at the organizational level called \"macro -\\nchallenges.\" \\nSome well-known technical challenges in mobile security are: managing th e registry settings \\nand configurations, authentication service security, cryptography security, Lightweight \\nDirectory Access Protocol (LDAP) security, remote access server (RAS) security, media \\nplayer control security, networking application program interface (API), security etc. \\n \\nRegistry Settings for Mobile Devices: \\nLet us understand the issue of registry settings on mobile devices through an example: \\nMicrosoft Activesync is meant for synchronization with Windows -powered personal \\ncomputers (PCs) and Micr osoft Outlook. ActiveSync acts as the \"gateway between \\nWindows-powered PC and Windows mobile -powered device, enabling the transfer of \\napplications such as Outlook information, Microsoft Office documents, pictures, music, \\nvideos and applications from a user\\'s desktop to his/her device. \\nIn addition to synchronizing with a PC, ActiveSync can synchronize directly with the \\nMicrosoft exchange server so that the users can keep their E -Mails, calendar, notes and \\ncontacts updated wirelessly when they are away from t heir PCs. In this context, registry \\nsetting becomes an important issue given the ease with which various applications allow a \\nfree flow of information. \\n \\nAuthentication Service Security: \\nThere are two components of security in mobile computing: security of devices and security \\nin networks. A secure network access involves authentication between the device and the \\nbase stations or Web servers. This is to ensure that only authenticated devices can be'),\n",

No Malicious Code can \\nimpersonate the service provider to trick the device into doing something it does not mean to. \\nThus, the networks also play a crucial role in security of mobile devices. \\nSome eminent kinds of attacks to which mobile devices are sub jected to are: push attacks, \\npull attacks and crash attacks. \\nAuthentication services security is important given the typical attacks on mobile devices \\nthrough wireless networks: Dos attacks, traffic analysis, eavesdropping, man -in-the-middle \\nattacks and se ssion hijacking. Security measures in this scenario come from Wireless \\nApplication Protocols (WAPs), use of VPNs, media access control (MAC) address filtering \\nand development in 802.xx standards. \\nAttacks on Mobile-Cell Phones: \\n\\uf0b7 Mobile Phone Theft: \\nMobile phones have become an integral part of everbody\\'s life and the mobile phone has \\ntransformed from being a luxury to a bare necessity. Increase in the purchasing power and \\navailability of numerous low cost handsets have also lead to an increase in mobile phone  \\nusers. Theft of mobile phones has risen dramatically over the past few years. Since huge \\nsection of working population in India use public transport, major locations where theft \\noccurs are bus stops, railway stations and traffic signals.  \\nThe following factors contribute for outbreaks on mobile devices: \\n1. Enough target terminals: The first Palm OS virus was seen after the number of Palm \\nOS devices reached 15 million. The first instance of a mobile virus was observed during \\nJune 2004 when it was discovered  that an organization \"Ojam\" had engineered an \\nantipiracy Trojan virus in older versions of their mobile phone game known as Mosquito. \\nThis virus sent SMS text messages to the organization without the users\\' knowledge. \\n2. Enough functionality:  Mobile devic es are increasingly being equipped with office \\nfunctionality and already carry critical data and applications, which are often protected \\ninsufficiently or not at all. The expanded functionality also increases the probability of \\nmalware. \\n3. Enough connectiv ity: Smartphones offer multiple communication options, such as \\nSMS, MMS, synchronization, Bluetooth, infrared (IR) and WLAN connections. \\nTherefore, unfortunately, the increased amount of freedom also offers more choices for \\nvirus writers. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Mobile - Viruses \\n\\uf0b7  Concept of Mishing \\n\\uf0b7  Concept of Vishing \\n\\uf0b7 Concept of Smishing \\n\\uf0b7 Hacking - Bluetooth \\nOrganizational security Policies and Measures in Mobile Computing Era: \\nProliferation of hand -held devices used makes the cybersecurity issue graver than what we \\nwould tend to think. People have grown so used to their hand -helds they are treating them \\nlike wallets! For example, people are storing  more types of confidential information on \\nmobile computing devices than their employers or they themselves know; they listen to music \\nusing their -hand-held devices.One should think about not to keep credit card and bank'),\n",

Imagine the business impact if an employee\\'s USB, \\npluggable drive or laptop was l ost or stolen, revealing sensitive customer data such as credit \\nreports, social security numbers (SSNs) and contact information.  \\nOperating Guidelines for Implementing Mobile Device Security Policies \\nIn situations such as those described above, the ideal s olution would be to prohibit all \\nconfidential data from being stored on mobile devices, but this may not always be practical. \\nOrganizations can, however, reduce the risk that confidential information will be accessed \\nfrom lost or stolen mobile devices through the following steps: \\n1. Determine whether the employees in the organization need to use mobile computing \\ndevices at all, based on their risks and benefits within the organization, industry and \\nregulatory environment. \\n2. Implement additional security technologies, as appropriate to fit both the organization \\nand the types of devices used. Most (and perhaps all) mobile computing devices will \\nneed to have their native security augmented with such tools as strong encryption, \\ndevice passwords and physical locks. Bi ometrics techniques can be used for \\nauthentication and encryption and have great potential to eliminate the challenges \\nassociated with passwords. \\n3. Standardize the mobile computing devices and the associated security tools being \\nused with them. As a matter o f fundamental principle, security deteriorates quickly as \\nthe tools and devices used become increasingly disparate. \\n4. Develop a specific framework for using mobile computing devices, including \\nguidelines for data syncing, the use of firewalls and anti -malware software and the \\ntypes of information that can be stored on them. \\n5. Centralize management of your mobile computing devices. Maintain an inventory so \\nthat you know who is using what kinds of devices., \\n6. Establish patching procedures for software on mobile dev ices. This can often be \\nsimplified by integrating patching with syncing or patch management with the \\ncentralized  \\n7. Provide education and awareness training to personnel using mobile devices. People \\ncannot be expected to appropriately secure their information if they have not been told \\nhow. \\nOrganizational Policies for the Use of Mobile Hand-Held Devices \\nThere are many ways to handle the matter of creating policy for mobile devices. One way is \\ncreating distinct mobile computing policy. Another way is including  such devices existing \\npolicy. There are also approaches in between where mobile devices fall under both existing \\npolicies and a new one.In the hybrid approach, a new policy is created to address the specific \\nneeds of the mobile devices but more general usage issues fall under general IT policies. As a \\npart of this approach, the \"acceptable use\" policy for other technologies is extended to the \\nmobile devices.  \\nCompanies new to mobile devices may adopt an umbrella mobile policy but they find over \\ntime the the they will need to modify their policies to match the challenges posed by different \\nkinds of mobile hand -held devices. For example, wireless devices pose different challenges \\nthan non-wireless Also, employees who use mobile devices more than 20%%  of the time will \\nhave different requirements than less-frequent users. It may happen that over time, companies \\nmay need to create separate policies for the mobile devices on the basis of whether they \\nconnect wirelessly and with distinctions for devices that connect to WANs and LANs .'),\n",

Although laptops, like other mobile devices, enhance the \\nbusiness functions owing to their mobile access to information anytime and anywhere, they \\nalso pose a large threat as they are portable Wireless capability in these devices has also \\nraised cyber security concerns owing to the information being transmitted over other, which \\nmakes it hard to detect. \\nThe thefts of laptops have always been a major issue, according to the cybersecurity industry \\nand insurance company statistics. Cybercriminals are targeting laptops that are expensive, to \\nenable them to fetch a quick profit in the black market. Ve ry few laptop. thieves. are actually \\ninterested in the information that is contained in the laptop. Most laptops contain personal \\nand corporate information that could be sensitive.. \\nPhysical Security Countermeasures \\nOrganizations are heavily dependent upon a mobile workforce with access to information, no \\nmatter where they travel. However, this mobility is putting organizations at risk of having a \\ndata breach if a laptop containing sensitive information is lost or stolen. Hence, physical \\nsecurity countermeasures are becoming very vital to protect the information on the employees \\nlaptops and to reduce the likelihood that employees will lose laptops.  \\n1. Cables and hardwired locks:  The most cost -efficient and ideal solution to safeguard any \\nmobile device is se curing with cables and locks, specially designed for laptops. Kensington \\ncables are one of the most popular brands in laptop security cable. These cables are made of \\naircraft-grade steel and Kevlar brand fiber, thus making these cables 40%%  stronger than any \\nother conventional security cables. One end of the security cable is fit into the universal \\nsecurity slot of the laptop and the other end is locked around any fixed furniture or item, thus \\nmaking a loop. These cables come with a variety of options such as number locks, key locks \\nand alarms. \\n \\n2. Laptop safes:  Safes made of polycarbonate - the same material that is used in bulletproof \\nwindows, police riot shields and bank security screens-can be used to carry and safeguard the \\nlaptops. The advantage of saf es over security cables is that they protect the whole laptop and \\nits devices such as CD -ROM bays, PCMCIA cards and HDD bays which can be easily \\nremoved in the case of laptops protected by security cables. \\n3. Motion sensors and alarms:  Even though alarms a nd motion sensors are annoying owing \\nto their false alarms and loud sound level, these devices are very efficient in securing laptops. \\nOnce these devices are activated, they can be used to track missing laptops in crowded \\nplaces. Also owing to their loud n ature, they help in deterring thieves. Modern systems for \\nlaptops are designed wherein the alarm device attached to the laptop transmits radio signals to \\na certain range around the laptop. \\n4. Warning labels and stamps:  Warning labels containing tracking in formation and \\nidentification details can be fixed onto the laptop to deter aspiring thieves. These labels \\ncannot be removed easily and are a low -cost solution to a laptop theft. These labels have an \\nidentification number that is stored in a universal datab ase for verification, which, in turn \\nmakes the resale of stolen laptops a difficult process. Such labels are highly recommended for \\nthe laptops issued to top executives and/or key employees of the organizations. \\n5. Other measures for protecting laptops are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Engraving the laptop with personal details \\n\\uf0b7 Keeping the laptop close to oneself wherever possible'),\n",

It’s not \\nreally that hard to keep yourself safe,  you just need to \\nfollow some simple rules. \\nThe first part of the workshop explains some of the \\ndangers you may encounter online. There are really  \\njust a handful of key threats, and knowing what they \\nare can help you to understand safe and unsafe \\nactions when you’re accessing the internet. \\nA key element of keeping yourself safe online is the \\nidea of trust, and we’ll look at this quite a bit more \\nas the workshop continues. On the internet, anybody \\ncan falsify their identity, so you need to know who you \\nshould accept emails from, where you shop, and who \\nyou give your personal details to.\\nJust as important as your online behaviour are the \\ntools that help protect your computer and personal \\ninformation.

For most people, there are three key dangers \\nto be aware of: malware, hackers and identity theft.\\nMalware (malicious software) is created with the \\nintention of accessing your computer and gathering \\ninformation, usually for the purpose of selling to other \\ninterested parties. The most commonly known type  \\nof malware is a virus (and the two terms are often used \\ninterchangeably) but others include spyware, adware, \\nworms and Trojan horses. Malware can do a variety  \\nof things, including:\\nSpying on your activity (spyware)\\nLetting someone remotely control your computer\\nActively damage your files and computer \\nSpread infection to other files and computers \\n(virus, worm)\\nForce you to watch ads (adware).\\nYou’ll nearly always get malware by running an infected \\nprogram. The program itself will probably work exactly \\nas normal; it just secretly installs a virus, spyware  \\nor adware when it’s run.\\nThat’s how the malware writers grab you: they take \\na program that’s appealing to you and slip a virus, \\nspyware or adware into it. That’s why they are often \\ncalled Trojan horses. \\nThis is why you need to be careful about which \\nprograms you download and run on your computer.  \\nIf you download a program from a disreputable  \\nsource, it may be infected.'),\n",

But there are automated \\nprograms called bots that might try and test your \\ncomputer’s defences.\\nEven these are vanishingly rare now, since most \\ncomputers have excellent defences against virtual \\nintruders. It’s highly unlikely that your computer  \\nis vulnerable out of the box unless it is very, very old.\\nWhat a hacker (or bot) does is try to exploit a vulnerability \\nin your computer’s security configuration.\\nAs an example, do you know about Windows file \\nsharing? This allows one computer to send documents \\nto another computer over a network. But if it’s not \\npassword protected, a hacker might detect that  \\nand use it to access your files – or implant a virus  \\nor other type of malware on your PC.\\nIDENTITY THEFT, \\nPHISHING AND \\nSCAMMERS\\nThese are things that are not trying to exploit  \\na technical vulnerability in your computer system  \\n– they’re trying to take advantage of you.\\nThere are no rules about who you can say you are  \\non the internet, so people can try to pretend they’re \\nsomething or someone they’re not in order to get you \\nto give them money or reveal personal information like \\ncredit card numbers and online banking logins.\\nEssentially, con artists have taken their business online.\\nA common scam is the phishing attempt, where the \\nscammer pretends to be a person or organisation that \\nyou have a relationship with, and gets you to give  \\nup private information, like your bank account details. \\nThe next pages shows examples of phishing emails.\\nPHISHING, A CLASSIC EXAMPLE\\nAn example of phishing is the online banking scam. In this case, the victim \\nreceives an email that looks like and purports to be from their bank. It often  \\nhas some dire warning about their finances, and says they need to log on to  \\ntheir online banking service in order to fix it. A web link is embedded in the email.\\nThe link does not lead to the real bank’s site, however, but to another site that’s \\nmade to look exactly like that of the real bank. The person would only know \\nif they looked at the web address in the browser Address bar. Then, when the \\nvictim logs in, their net banking password is harvested by the scammer.'),\n",

Here are a few things to look out for.\\nCheck the subject of the email and the sender. Is \\nit from someone you know, and does it describe \\nsomething you remember signing up for? If not, it’s \\nprobably spam.\\nIs there an offer a free money in exchange for your \\npersonal information?

Your computer \\ncomes with some security software built-in, but you \\nshould add additional software on top of that. There \\nare different types of security software you can get:\\nAnti-virus: Software that protects your computer \\nfrom most types of malware (and relies on your \\ncomputer’s built-in defences for the rest). You can \\nget antivirus software for free or a small charge.\\nInternet security suites:  A package of software \\nthat protects your computer from a whole range  \\nof threats, including malware, scammers, junk \\nemail, trick websites, hackers, and much more. \\nInternet security suites have an annual fee \\n(usually between $60 and $130). \\nTo break it down a little more, defending your computer \\nfrom internet threats involves a number of elements:\\nA firewall acts like a security checkpoint for \\ninternet traffic – it only allows authorised traffic \\nthrough. If somebody outside tries to talk to your \\ncomputer without authorisation, they can’t.  \\nIf a program on your computer tries to talk  \\nto the internet, it will either be stopped, allowed, \\nor a popup will appear asking you if you’d like to  \\nlet the program communicate with the internet.  \\nOn a Windows PC, the popup will look like this: \\nYour computer comes with a firewall built in. \\nA firewall blocks access \\nto your computer\\nPROTECTING  \\nYOUR COMPUTER'),\n",

Your \\ncomputer likely does not come with anti-virus \\nsoftware, and you should install one.\\nThose are the key elements of security, but an internet \\nsecurity suite can offer an even broader range  \\nof protections, including:\\nParental controls, which prevent websites with \\nobjectionable content (like offensive language  \\nand nudity) from loading on your computer\\nBackup, which automates the backup of your \\nimportant data to external storage devices\\nSpam filters, which prevent scam and junk email \\nfrom reaching your inbox\\nWeb filters, which prevent you from visiting  \\nthe websites of known scammers\\nIdentity theft protection, which prevents personal \\ndata from being sent over the internet.\\nHOW TO USE  \\nPROTECTION\\nMostly you don’t have to do much to use either internet \\nsuites or standalone antivirus programs. They usually \\nrun in the background of your computer, and the only \\nreason you’ll know they’re running at all is that there \\nwill be a small icon at the bottom of your screen.\\nIf you double-click on that icon, you can see the full \\ninterface for the security software. \\nYou probably won’t have to do that very often (if ever)  \\n– security software is mostly automatic.\\nIt’s likely you’ll only know that security software is \\nrunning when something bad happens (for example, \\nwhen it detects a virus), and a popup will appear asking \\nyou what you’d like to do about it.\\nIf you have time, your presenter can show you a simple \\nantivirus application (such as Microsoft Security \\nEssentials) being installed.\\nHome screen of a security \\nsoftware program'),\n",

Even \\na free anti-virus program improves the security of your \\ncomputer dramatically.\\nBut that’s not the whole solution: security software \\ncan’t protect you from con artists and tricksters.  \\nThere are, however, five simple things you can  \\ndo to keep yourself safe:\\n1. Don’t post personal information on public sites\\nLots of sites would like you to give them your personal \\ninformation: name, date of birth, address, email \\naddress and so on. In some cases, such as shopping \\nsites, it’s necessary and legitimate. On others, like \\nFacebook, you don’t need to (and should not) provide \\nprivate information. It can be used to track and scam \\nyou.\\n2. Don’t open email attachments unless you’re really sure\\nOne of the most common sources of malware \\ninfections is email attachments.\\nEmail attachments are files that come with emails on \\nyour computer.\\nIf you remember what we said earlier about  \\nyou needing to run a program to get infected with \\nmalware, this is how you often get trapped: an email \\nwill come in with a program attached and some kind \\nof exhortation to run it, like Run this program, it’s \\nawesome!\\nThese can even come from people you know and trust. \\nThey might send you the malware not knowing it’s \\nadware or spyware, and there is virus malware which \\ncan actually hijack the email of infected computers \\nand send out copies of themselves to everybody in the \\ninfected person’s address book.\\nThe short of it is, if you’re not sure, don’t open the \\nattachment.\\nThat’s not to say don’t use email attachments  \\nat all. If you receive a specific document or picture that \\nyou’re expecting, it’s fine to open it.\\nDon’t publish private information \\nto social media sites\\nBe careful about opening \\nemail attachments'),\n",

Be careful about what emails you respond to\\nEmails can be made to appear as if they come from \\nanybody, kind of like letters with a fake sender address.\\nIf an email asks you to give up private information, \\nfollow a web link to an external website or anything \\nthat seems shady, don’t respond to it. Don’t engage at \\nall; delete it and move on.\\nIf you’re really worried – for example, if you get  \\nan email from your bank – you can always call them  \\nor manually go their website (don’t follow  \\nthe link from the email).\\n4. Be careful who you give credit card details to\\nOne of the great things about the internet is that  \\nit’s the world’s largest shopping mall. Hundreds  \\nof thousands of stores around the world are a click \\naway. But not all of them can be trusted.\\nIf you’re not sure about a given store, it’s a good idea \\nto do a Google search on the name of that store, which \\ncan give you background information on it. If it has a \\nbad reputation, a Google search will likely reveal it.\\nServices like PayPal allow you to buy things without \\ngiving up credit card details to a store. We cover that \\nmore in our Online Shopping and Banking workshops.\\n5. Don’t install programs from untrustworthy sources\\nMalware generally comes attached to other \\n(legitimate-looking) programs.\\nWhen you download a program from a shady \\nsource, which can include popular peer-to-peer \\ndownload sites such as BitTorrent, you run the risk of \\ndownloading malware.\\nHow do you know if a site or program is shady? One \\ngood way to find out is to run a Google search on the \\nsite name or file name to see if anybody else has had \\nproblems.\\nIf the download site has user comments, you  \\ncan also check those – if the program is infected, \\nsomebody might have noted it.\\nDo not click on links in \\nsuspect emails\\nUse services that don’t involve \\nsharing credit card details\\nResearch suspect programs \\nor sites'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Safety-6.pdf'}, page_content='INTRODUCTION TO CYBER SAFETY\\n PAGE 13\\nSECURITY  \\nSOFTWARE IS  \\nNOT ENOUGH\\nAfter downloading a program, you can run a virus \\nscan on it immediately. Malware is not active until \\nyou actually run a program. If you use a Windows \\ncomputer, go to the folder that you downloaded \\nthe program to. Right-click on it, and select Scan \\nwith...[name of antivirus program] from the  \\ndrop-down list.\\nWHAT  \\nHAPPENS  \\nIF I GET  \\nINFECTED?\\nIf your security software does find malware, it will \\nlikely ask you what to do with it. A popup will appear on \\nyour computer looking something like this: \\nDon’t panic – this is the security software working. \\nGenerally you want to remove or quarantine the \\nmalware. Choose the option to do so. That should \\nremove the virus and the threat. Problem solved.\\nEven so, it’s always a good idea to make copies \\n(backups) of the files and photos you think are \\nimportant!

If you have a Windows computer, click \\non the Start button on the bottom left, then on Control \\nPanel. Then select Back up your Computer. Windows \\nwill walk you through the backup process. \\nMany computers have \\nbuilt-in backup features\\nWHY ANNUAL FEES?\\nInternet security suites nearly always charge an annual fee, rather than a straight-up, buy-\\nonce price.

Individuals, \\nsmall-scale businesses or large organization, are all being impacted. So, all these firms \\nwhether IT or non -IT firms have understood the importance of Cyber Security and focusin g \\non adopting all possible measures to deal with cyber threats. \\nWhat is cyber security? \\n\"Cyber security is primarily about people, processes, and technologies working together to \\nencompass the full range of threat reduction, vulnerability reduction, deterr ence, international \\nengagement, incident response, resiliency, and recovery policies and activities, including \\ncomputer network operations, information assurance, law enforcement, etc.\" \\nOR \\nCyber security is the body of technologies, processes, and practice s designed to protect \\nnetworks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. \\n\\uf0b7 The term cyber security refers  to techniques and practices designed to protect digital \\ndata. \\n\\uf0b7 The data that is stored, transmitted or used on an information system.  \\nOR \\nCyber security is the protection of Internet -connected systems, including hardware, software, \\nand data from cyber attacks.  \\nIt is made up of two words one is cyber and other is security.                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\uf0b7 Cyber is related to the technology which contains systems, network and programs or \\ndata.  \\n\\uf0b7 Whereas security related to the protection whi ch includes systems security, network \\nsecurity and application and information security. \\nWhy is cyber security important?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\nListed below are the reasons w hy cyber security is so important in  what’s become a \\npredominant digital world: \\n\\uf0b7 Cyber attacks can be extremely expensive for businesses to endure. \\n\\uf0b7 In addition to financial damage suffered by the business, a  data breach can also inflict \\nuntold reputational damage. \\n\\uf0b7 Cyber-attacks these days are  becoming progressively destructive. Cybercriminals are \\nusing more sophisticated ways to initiate cyber attacks.'),\n",

It uses malicious code to \\nalter computer code, logic or data and le ad to cybercrimes, such as information and identity \\ntheft. \\nCyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories: \\n1) Web-based attacks \\n2) System-based attacks \\nWeb-based attacks \\nThese are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of t he important \\nweb-based attacks are as follows- \\n1. Injection attacks \\nIt is the attack in which some data will be injected into a web application to manipulate the \\napplication and fetch the required information. \\nExample- SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection etc. \\n2. DNS Spoofing \\nDNS Spoofing is a type of computer security hacking. Whereby a data is introduced into a \\nDNS resolver's cache causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting \\ntraffic to the attackers  computer or any other computer. The DNS spoofing attacks can go on \\nfor a long period of time without being detected and can cause serious security issues. \\n3. Session Hijacking \\nIt is a security attack on a user session over a protected network. Web applications cr eate \\ncookies to store the state and user sessions. By stealing the cookies, an attacker can have \\naccess to all of the user data. \\n4. Phishing \\nPhishing is a type of attack which attempts to steal sensitive information like user login \\ncredentials and credit c ard number. It occurs when an attacker is masquerading as a \\ntrustworthy entity in electronic communication. \\n5. Brute force \\nIt is a type of attack which uses a trial and error method. This attack generates a large number \\nof guesses and validates them to obt ain actual data like user password and personal \\nidentification number. This attack may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by \\nsecurity, analysts to test an organization's network security.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 8 \\n \\n6. Denial of Service \\nIt is an attack which meant to m ake a server or network resource unavailable to the users. It \\naccomplishes this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a \\ncrash. It uses the single system and single internet connection to attack a server. It can be \\nclassified into the following- \\nVolume-based attacks - Its goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and is \\nmeasured in bit per second. \\nProtocol attacks- It consumes actual server resources, and is measured in a packet. \\nApplication layer attacks- Its goal is to crash the web server and is measured in request per \\nsecond. \\n7. Dictionary attacks \\nThis type of attack stored the list of a commonly used password and validated them to get \\noriginal password. \\n8. URL Interpretation \\nIt is a type of attack where we can change the certain parts of a URL, and one can make a \\nweb server to deliver web pages for which he is not authorized to browse. \\n9. File Inclusion attacks \\nIt is a type of attack that allows an attacker to access unauthorized or essential files which is \\navailable on the web server or to execute malicious files on the web server by making use of \\nthe include functionality. \\n10. Man in the middle attacks \\nIt is a type of attack that allows an attacker to intercepts the connection between client and \\nserver and acts as a bridge between them. Due to this, an attacker will be able to read, insert \\nand modify the data in the intercepted connection. \\nSystem-based attacks \\nThese are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. \\nSome of the important system-based attacks are as follows- \\n1. Virus \\nIt is a type of malicious software program that spread throughout the computer files without \\nthe knowledge of a user. It is a self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates by \\ninserting copies of itself into other computer programs when executed. It can also execute \\ninstructions that cause harm to the system.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 9 \\n \\n2. Worm \\nIt is a type of malware whose primary function is to replicate itself to spread to uninfected \\ncomputers. It works same  as the computer virus. Worms often originate from email \\nattachments that appear to be from trusted senders. \\n3. Trojan horse \\nIt is a malicious program that occurs unexpected changes to computer setting and unusual \\nactivity, even when the computer should be  idle. It misleads the user of its true intent. It \\nappears to be a normal application but when opened/executed some malicious code will run \\nin the background. \\n4. Backdoors \\nIt is a method that bypasses the normal authentication process. A developer may crea te a \\nbackdoor so that an application or operating system can be accessed for troubleshooting or \\nother purposes. \\n5. Bots \\nA bot (short for \"robot\") is an automated process that interacts with other network services. \\nSome bots program run automatically, while  others only execute commands when they \\nreceive specific input. Common examples of bots program are the crawler, chatroom bots, \\nand malicious bots.'),\n",

Human \\nsecurity controls include phishing simulations and access management controls that protect \\nmission cr itical assets from a wide variety of human threats, including cyber criminals, \\nmalicious insiders, and negligent users. \\n \\nVulnerability, threat, Harmful acts \\nAs the recent epidemic of data breaches illustrates, no system is immune to attacks. Any \\ncompany th at manages, transmits, stores, or otherwise handles data has to institute and \\nenforce mechanisms to monitor their cyber environment, identify vulnerabilities, and close up \\nsecurity holes as quickly as possible. \\nBefore identifying specific dangers to modern  data systems, it is crucial to understand the \\ndistinction between cyber threats and vulnerabilities. \\n \\nCyber threats are security incidents or circumstances with the potential to have a negative \\noutcome for your network or other data management systems. \\nExamples of common types of security threats include  phishing attacks that result in the \\ninstallation of  malware that infects your data, failure of a staff member to follow data \\nprotection protocols that cause a  data breach, or even a tornado that takes down  your \\ncompany’s data headquarters, disrupting access. \\n \\nVulnerabilities are the gaps or weaknesses in a system that make threats possible and tempt \\nthreat actors to exploit them. \\n \\nTypes of vulnerabilities in network security include but are not limited to  SQL injections, \\nserver misconfigurations, cross -site scripting, and transmitting sensitive data in a non -\\nencrypted plain text format. \\nWhen threat probability is multiplied by the potential loss that may result, cyber security \\nexperts, refer to this as a risk.'),\n",

In a sense, the purpose of computer security is to prevent these criminals from doing \\ndamage. \\nWe say  computer crime  is any crime involving a computer or aided by the use of one.  \\nAlthough this definition is admittedly broad, it allows us to consider ways to protect \\nourselves, our businesses, and our communities against those who use computers maliciously. \\nOne approach to prevention or moderation is to understand who commits these crimes and \\nwhy. Many studies have attempted to determine the characteristics of computer criminals. By \\nstudying those who have already used computers to commit crimes, we may be able in the \\nfuture to spot likely criminals and prevent the crimes from occurring.  \\nCIA Triad \\nThe CIA Triad is actually a security model that has been developed to help people think \\nabout various parts of IT security. \\nCIA triad broken down: \\nConfidentiality \\nIt's crucial in today's world for people to protect their sensitive, private information from \\nunauthorized access. \\nProtecting confidentiality is dependent on being able to define and enforce certain access \\nlevels for information.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 12 \\n \\nIn some cases, doing this involves separating information into various collections that are \\norganized by who needs access to the information and how sensitive that information actually \\nis - i.e. the amount of damage suffered if the confidentiality was breached. \\nSome of the most common means used to manage confidentiality include access control lists, \\nvolume and file encryption, and Unix file permissions. \\nIntegrity \\nData integrity is what the \"I\" in CIA Triad stands for. \\nThis is an essential component of the CIA Triad and designed to protect data from deletion or \\nmodification from any unauthorized party, and it ensures that when an authorized person \\nmakes a change that should not have been made the damage can be reversed. \\nAvailability \\nThis is the final component of the CIA Triad and refers to the actual availability of your data. \\nAuthentication mechanisms, acc ess channels and systems all have to work properly for the \\ninformation they protect and ensure it\\'s available when it is needed. \\nUnderstanding the CIA triad \\nThe CIA Triad is all about information. While this is considered the core factor of the \\nmajority of IT security, it promotes a limited view of the security that ignores other important \\nfactors.  \\nFor example, even though availability may serve to make sure you don\\'t lose access to \\nresources needed to provide information when it is needed, thinking about information \\nsecurity in itself doesn\\'t guarantee that someone else hasn\\'t used your hardware resources \\nwithout authorization. \\nIt\\'s important to understand what the CIA Triad is, how it is used to plan and also to \\nimplement a quality security policy while u nderstanding the various principles behind it. It\\'s \\nalso important to understand the limitations it presents. When you are informed, you can \\nutilize the CIA Triad for what it has to offer and avoid the consequences that may come along \\nby not understanding it. \\nAssets and Threat \\nWhat is an  Asset: An asset is any data, device or other component of an organization’s \\nsystems that is valuable – often because it contains sensitive data or can be used to access \\nsuch information. \\nFor example: An employee’s desktop c omputer, laptop or company phone would be \\nconsidered an asset, as would applications on those devices. Likewise, critical infrastructure, \\nsuch as servers and support systems, are assets. An organization’s most common assets are \\ninformation assets. These ar e things such as databases and physical files – i.e. the sensitive \\ndata that you store'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content=\"CYBER SECURITY Page 13 \\n \\nWhat is a threat:  A threat  is any incident that could negatively affect an asset – for \\nexample, if it’s lost, knocked offline or accessed by an unauthorized party. \\nThreats can be categorized as circumstances that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or \\navailability of an asset, and can either be intentional or accidental. \\nIntentional threats include things such as criminal hacking or a malicious insider stealing \\ninformation, whereas accidental threats generally involve employee error, a technical \\nmalfunction or an event that causes physical damage, such as a fire or natural disaster. \\nMotive of Attackers \\nThe categories of cyber -attackers enable us to better understand the attackers' motivations \\nand the actions they take. As shown in Figure, operational cyber security risks arise from \\nthree types of actions: i) inadvertent actions (generally by insiders) that are taken without \\nmalicious or harmful intent; ii) deliberate actions (by insiders or outsiders) that are taken \\nintentionally and are meant to do harm; and iii) inaction (generally by insiders), such as a \\nfailure to act in a given situation, either because of a lack of appropriate skills, knowledge, \\nguidance, or avai lability of the correct person to take action Of primary concern here are \\ndeliberate actions, of which there are three categories of motivation. \\n1. Political motivations: examples include destroying, disrupting, or taking control of \\ntargets; espionage; and making political statements, protests, or retaliatory actions. \\n2. Economic motivations: examples include theft of intellectual property or other \\neconomically valuable assets (e.g., funds, credit card information); fraud; industrial \\nespionage and sabotage; and blackmail. \\n3. Socio-cultural motivations: examples include attacks with philosophical, theological, \\npolitical, and even humanitarian goals. Socio-cultural motivations also include fun, \\ncuriosity, and a desire for publicity or ego gratification. \\n \\n \\nTypes of cyber-attacker actions and their motivations when deliberate\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content=\"CYBER SECURITY Page 14 \\n \\nActive attacks: An active attack is a network exploit in which a hacker attempts to make \\nchanges to data on the target or data en route to the target. \\nTypes of Active attacks: \\nMasquerade: in this attack, the intruder pretends to be a particular user of a system to gain \\naccess or to gain greater privileges than they are authorized for.  A masquerade may be \\nattempted through the use of stolen login IDs and passwords, through finding security gaps in \\nprograms or through bypassing the authentication mechanism. \\nSession replay: In this type of attack, a hack er steals an authorized user’s log in information \\nby stealing the session ID. The intruder gains access and the ability to do anything the \\nauthorized user can do on the website. \\nMessage modification: In this attack, an intruder alters packet header address es to direct a \\nmessage to a different destination or modify the data on a target machine. \\nIn a denial of service  (DoS) attack, users are deprived of access to a network or web  \\nresource. This is generally accomplished by overwhelming the target with more traffic than it \\ncan handle. \\nIn a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) exploit, large numbers of compromised systems \\n(sometimes called a botnet or zombie army) attack a single target. \\nPassive Attacks: Passive attacks are relatively scarce from a classification perspective, but \\ncan be carried out with relative ease, particularly if the traffic is not encrypted. \\n \\nTypes of Passive attacks: \\nEavesdropping (tapping): the attacker simply listens to messages exchanged by two entities. \\nFor the attack to be useful, the traffic must not be encrypted. Any unencrypted information, \\nsuch as a password sent in response to an HTTP request, may be retrieved by the attacker. \\n \\nTraffic analysis: the attacker looks at the metadata transmitted in traffic in order to deduce \\ninformation relating to the exchange and the participating entities, e.g. the form of the \\nexchanged traffic (rate, duration, etc.). In the cases where  encrypted data  are used, traffic \\nanalysis can also lead to attacks by  cryptanalysis, whereby the attacker may obtain \\ninformation or succeed in unencrypting the traffic. \\nSoftware Attacks: Malicious code (sometimes called malware) is a type of software \\ndesigned to take over or damage a computer user's operating system, without the user's \\nknowledge or approval. It can be very difficult to remove and very damaging. Common \\nmalware examples are listed in the following table:\"),\n",

A virus: \\n\\uf0b7 Requires a host to replicate and usually attaches itself to a host file or a \\nhard drive sector. \\n\\uf0b7 Replicates each time the host is used. \\n\\uf0b7 Often focuses on destruction or corruption of data. \\n\\uf0b7 Usually attaches to files with execution capabilities such as .doc, .exe, and \\n.bat extensions. \\n\\uf0b7 Often distributes via e-mail. Many viruses can e-mail themselves to \\neveryone in your address book. \\n\\uf0b7 Examples: Stoned, Michelangelo, Melissa, I Love You. \\nWorm A worm is a self-replicating program that can be designed to do any number of \\nthings, such as delete files or send documents via e-mail. A worm can negatively \\nimpact network traffic just in the process of replicating itself. A worm: \\n\\uf0b7 Can install a backdoor in the infected computer. \\n\\uf0b7 Is usually introduced into the system through a vulnerability. \\n\\uf0b7 Infects one system and spreads to other systems on the network. \\n\\uf0b7 Example: Code Red. \\nTrojan \\nhorse \\nA Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software. \\nDiscretionary environments are often more vulnerable and susceptible to Trojan \\nhorse attacks because security is user focused and user directed. Thus the \\ncompromise of a user account could lead to the compromise of the entire \\nenvironment. A Trojan horse: \\n\\uf0b7 Cannot replicate itself. \\n\\uf0b7 Often contains spying functions (such as a packet sniffer) or backdoor \\nfunctions that allow a computer to be remotely controlled from the \\nnetwork. \\n\\uf0b7 Often is hidden in useful software such as screen savers or games. \\n\\uf0b7 Example: Back Orifice, Net Bus, Whack-a-Mole. \\nLogic \\nBomb \\nA Logic Bomb is malware that lies dormant until triggered. A logic bomb is a \\nspecific example of an asynchronous attack. \\n\\uf0b7 A trigger activity may be a specific date and time, the launching of a \\nspecific program, or the processing of a specific type of activity. \\n\\uf0b7 Logic bombs do not self-replicate.'),\n",

The cyberspace is anticipated to become even more complex in the \\nupcoming years, with the increase in networks and devices connected to it. \\n \\nREGULATIONS \\nThere are five predominant laws to cover when it comes to cybersecurity:  \\nInformation Technology Act, 2000 The Indian cyber laws are governed by the Information \\nTechnology Act, penned down back in 2000. The principal impetus of this Act is to offer \\nreliable legal inclusiveness to  eCommerce, facilitating registration of real -time records with \\nthe Government.  \\nBut with the cyber attackers getting sneakier, topped by the human tendency to misuse \\ntechnology, a series of amendments followed.  \\nThe ITA, enacted by the Parliament of India , highlights the grievous punishments and \\npenalties safeguarding the e-governance, e-banking, and e-commerce sectors. Now, the scope \\nof ITA has been enhanced to encompass all the latest communication devices. \\nThe IT Act is the salient one, guiding the enti re Indian legislation to govern cybercrimes \\nrigorously:  \\nSection 43  - Applicable to people who damage the computer systems without permission \\nfrom the owner. The owner can fully claim compensation for the entire damage in such cases. \\nSection 66 - Applicable in case a person is found to dishonestly or fraudulently committing \\nany act referred to in section 43. The imprisonment term in such instances can mount up to \\nthree years or a fine of up to Rs. 5 lakh.  \\nSection 66B - Incorporates the punishments for fraudulently receiving stolen communication \\ndevices or computers, which confirms a probable three years imprisonment. This term can \\nalso be topped by Rs. 1 lakh fine, depending upon the severity.  \\nSection 66C  - This section scrutinizes the identity thefts rela ted to imposter digital \\nsignatures, hacking passwords, or other distinctive identification features.

This process can involve \\nanything from breaking encryption, to executing search warrants with a law enforcement \\nteam, to recovering and analyzing files from hard drives that will be  critical evidence in the \\nmost serious civil and criminal cases. \\n \\nThe forensic examination of computers, and data storage media, is a complicated and highly \\nspecialized process. The results of forensic examinations are compiled and included in \\nreports. In many cases, examiners testify to their findings, where their skills and abilities are \\nput to ultimate scrutiny. \\n \\nDIGITAL FORENSICS: \\nDigital Forensics is defined as the process of preservation, identification, extraction, and \\ndocumentation of computer evidence which can be used by the court of law. It is a science of \\nfinding evidence from digital media like a computer, mobile phone, server, or network. It \\nprovides the forensic team with the best techniques and tools to solve complicated digital -\\nrelated cases. \\nDigital Forensics helps the forensic team to analyzes, inspect, identifies, and preserve the \\ndigital evidence residing on various types of electronic devices. \\nDigital forensic science is a branch of forensic science that focuses on the recovery and \\ninvestigation of material found in digital devices related to cybercrime. \\nTHE NEED FOR COMPUTER FORENSICS \\nComputer forensics is also important because it can save your organization money. ... From a \\ntechnical standpoint, the main goal of  computer forensics is to identify, collect, preserve, and \\nanalyze data in a way that preserves the integrity of the evidence collected so it can be used \\neffectively in a legal case. \\nCYBER FORENSICS AND DIGITAL EVIDENCE: \\nDigital evidence is information stored or transmitted in bi nary form that may be relied on in \\ncourt. It can be found on a computer hard drive, a mobile phone, among other places. Digital \\nevidence is commonly associated with electronic crime, or e -crime, such as child \\npornography or credit card fraud. However, digi tal evidence is now used to prosecute all \\ntypes of crimes, not just e -crime. For example, suspects' e -mail or mobile phone files might \\ncontain critical evidence regarding their intent, their whereabouts at the time of a crime and \\ntheir relationship with other suspects. In 2005, for example, a floppy disk led investigators to \\nthe BTK serial killer who had eluded police capture since 1974 and claimed the lives of at \\nleast 10 victims.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 24 \\n \\nIn an effort to fight e -crime and to collect relevant digital evidence for a ll crimes, law \\nenforcement agencies are incorporating the collection and analysis of digital evidence, also \\nknown as computer forensics, into their infrastructure. Law enforcement agencies are \\nchallenged by the need to train officers to collect digital evi dence and keep up with rapidly \\nevolving technologies such as computer operating systems. \\n \\n \\nFORENSICS ANALYSIS OF EMAIL: \\nE-mail forensics refers to the study of source and content of e-mail as evidence to identify the \\nactual sender and recipient of a messag e, data/time of transmission, detailed record of e -mail \\ntransaction, intent of the sender, etc. This study involves investigation of metadata, keyword \\nsearching, port scanning, etc. for authorship attribution and identification of e-mail scams. \\nVarious approaches that are used for e-mail forensic are: \\n\\uf0b7 Header Analysis  – Meta data in the e -mail message in the form of control \\ninformation i.e. envelope and headers including headers in the message body contain \\ninformation about the sender and/or the path along w hich the message has traversed. \\nSome of these may be spoofed to conceal the identity of the sender. A detailed \\nanalysis of these headers and their correlation is performed in header analysis. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Bait Tactics – In bait tactic investigation an e -mail with http: “<imgsrc>” tag having \\nimage source at some computer monitored by the investigators is send to the sender of \\ne-mail under investigation containing real (genuine) e -mail address. When the e -mail \\nis opened, a log entry containing the IP address of the recip ient (sender of the e -mail \\nunder investigation) is recorded on the http server hosting the image and thus sender \\nis tracked. However, if the recipient (sender of the e-mail under investigation) is using \\na proxy server then IP address of the proxy server is  recorded. The log on proxy \\nserver can be used to track the sender of the e -mail under investigation. If the proxy \\nserver’s log is unavailable due to some reason, then investigators may send the tactic \\ne-mail containing a) Embedded Java Applet that runs on  receiver’s computer or b) \\nHTML page with Active X Object. Both aiming to extract IP address of the receiver’s \\ncomputer and e-mail it to the investigators. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Server Investigation – In this investigation, copies of delivered e -mails and server \\nlogs are investigated to identify source of an e-mail message. E-mails purged from the \\nclients (senders or receivers) whose recovery is impossible may be requested from \\nservers (Proxy or ISP) as most of them store a copy of all e -mails after their \\ndeliveries. Further, l ogs maintained by servers can be studied to trace the address of \\nthe computer responsible for making the e -mail transaction. However, servers store \\nthe copies of e -mail and server logs only for some limited periods and some may not \\nco-operate with the inve stigators. Further, SMTP servers which store data like credit \\ncard number and other data pertaining to owner of a mailbox can be used to identify \\nperson behind an e-mail address. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Network Device Investigation – In this form of e-mail investigation, logs maintained \\nby the network devices such as routers, firewalls and switches are used to investigate'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 25 \\n \\nthe source of an e -mail message. This form of investigation is complex and is used \\nonly when the logs of servers (Proxy or ISP) are unavailable due to some reas on, e.g. \\nwhen ISP or proxy does not maintain a log or lack of co -operation by ISP’s or failure \\nto maintain chain of evidence. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Software Embedded Identifiers  – Some information about the creator of e -mail, \\nattached files or documents may be included with th e message by the e-mail software \\nused by the sender for composing e -mail. This information may be included in the \\nform of custom headers or in the form of MIME content as a Transport Neutral \\nEncapsulation Format (TNEF). Investigating the e -mail for these d etails may reveal \\nsome vital information about the senders e -mail preferences and options that could \\nhelp client side evidence gathering. The investigation can reveal PST file names, \\nWindows logon username, MAC address, etc. of the client computer used to send e-\\nmail message. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Sender Mailer Fingerprints  – Identification of software handling e -mail at server \\ncan be revealed from the Received header field and identification of software \\nhandling e-mail at client can be ascertained by using different set of hea ders like “X-\\nMailer” or equivalent. These headers describe applications and their versions used at \\nthe clients to send e -mail. This information about the client computer of the sender \\ncan be used to help investigators devise an effective plan and thus prov e to be very \\nuseful. \\nEMAIL FORENSICS TOOLS \\nErasing or deleting an email doesn’t necessarily mean that it is gone forever. Often emails \\ncan be forensically extracted even after deletion. Forensic tracing of e -mail is similar to \\ntraditional detective work. It is used for retrieving information from mailbox files. \\n\\uf0b7 MiTec Mail Viewer  – This is a viewer for Outlook Express, Windows \\nMail/Windows Live Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird message databases, and single EML \\nfiles. It displays a list of contained messages with al l needed properties, like an \\nordinary e -mail client. Messages can be viewed in detailed view, including \\nattachments and an HTML preview. It has powerful searching and filtering capability \\nand also allows extracting email addresses from all emails in opened  folder to list by \\none click. Selected messages can be saved to eml files with or without their \\nattachments. Attachments can be extracted from selected messages by one command. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 OST and PST Viewer – Nucleus Technologies’ OST and PST viewer tools help you \\nview OST and PST files easily without connecting to an MS Exchange server. These \\ntools allow the user to scan OST and PST files and they display the data saved in it \\nincluding email messages, contacts, calendars, notes, etc., in a proper folder structure. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 eMailTrackerPro – eMailTrackerPro analyses the headers of an e -mail to detect the \\nIP address of the machine that sent the message so that the sender can be tracked \\ndown. It can trace multiple e -mails at the same time and easily keep track of them. \\nThe geog raphical location of an IP address is key information for determining the \\nthreat level or validity of an e-mail message.'),\n",

The foundation of forensics is using a \\nmethodical approach to reach appropriate conclusions based on the available data or \\ndetermine that no conclusion can yet be drawn.  \\nReporting: The process of preparing and presenting the information resulting from the \\nanalysis phase. Many factors affect reporting, including the following:  \\na. Alternative Explanations:When the information regarding an event is incomplete, it \\nmay not be possible to arrive at a definitive explanation of what happened. When an \\nevent has two or more plausible explanations, each should be given due consideration \\nin the reporting process.

Moreover, IP \\ndata world when compared to voice-centric security threats is new to mobile operators. There \\nare numerous attacks that can be committed against mobile networks and they can originate \\nfrom two primary vectors. One is from outside the mobile network - that is, public Internet, \\nprivate networks and other operator\\'s networks - and the other is within the mobile networks - \\nthat is, devices such as data -capable handsets and Smartphones, notebook computers or even \\ndesktop computers connected to the 3G network. \\nPopular types of attacks against 3G mobile networks are as follows: \\n1. Malwares, viruses and worms:  Although many users are still in the transient process of \\nswitching from  2G,2.5G2G,2.5G to 3G,3G, it is a growing need to educate the community \\npeople and provide awareness of such threats that exist while using mobile devices. Here are \\nfew examples of malware(s) specific to mobile devices: \\n\\uf0b7 Skull Trojan: I targets Series 60 phones equipped with the Symbian mobile OS. \\n\\uf0b7 Cabir Worm: It is the first dedicated mobile -phone worm infects phones running on \\nSymbian OS and scans other mobile devices to send a copy of itself to the first \\nvulnerable phone it finds through Bluetooth Wireless technology. The worst thing \\nabout this worm is that the source code for the Cabir -H and Cabir -I viruses is \\navailable online. \\n\\uf0b7 Mosquito Trojan:  It affects the Series 60 Smartphones and is a cracked version of \\n\"Mosquitos\" mobile phone game. \\n\\uf0b7 Brador Trojan: It affects the Windows CE OS by creating a svchost. exe file in the \\nWindows start-up folder which allows full control of the device. This executable file \\nis conductive to traditional worm propagation vector such as E-Mail file attachments. \\n\\uf0b7 Lasco Worm: It was released first in 2005 to target PDAs and mobile phones running \\nthe Symbian OS. Lasco is based on Cabir\\'s source code and replicates over Bluetooth \\nconnection. \\n2. Denial -of-service (DoS):  The main objective behind this attack is to make the system  \\nunavailable to the intended users. Virus attacks can be used to damage the system to make the \\nsystem unavailable. Presently, one of the most common cyber security threats to wired \\nInternet service providers (iSPs) is a distributed denial -of-service (DDos)  attack .DDoS'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 33 \\n \\nattacks are used to flood the target system with the data so that the response from the target \\nsystem is either slowed or stopped. \\n3. Overbilling attack:  Overbilling involves an attacker hijacking a subscriber\\'s IP address \\nand then using it ( i.e., the connection) to initiate downloads that are not \"Free downloads\" or \\nsimply use it for his/her own purposes. In either case, the legitimate user is charged for the \\nactivity which the user did not conduct or authorize to conduct. \\n4. Spoofed policy d evelopment process (PDP):  These of attacks exploit the vulnerabilities \\nin the GTP [General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol]. \\n5. Signaling-level attacks: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol used \\nin IP multimedia subs ystem (IMS) networks to provide Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) \\nservices. There are several vulnerabilities with SIP-based VolP systems. \\nCredit Card Frauds in Mobile and Wireless Computing Era: \\nThese are new trends in cybercrime that are coming up with  mobile computing - mobile \\ncommerce (M -Commerce) and mobile banking (M -Banking). Credit card frauds are now \\nbecoming commonplace given the ever -increasing power and the ever -reducing prices of the \\nmobile hand-held devices, factors that result in easy avail ability of these gadgets to almost \\nanyone. Today belongs to \"mobile compüting,\" that is, anywhere anytime computing. The \\ndevelopments in wireless technology have fuelled this new mode of working for white collar \\nworkers. This is true for credit card proces sing too; wireless credit card processing is a \\nrelatively new service that will allow a person to process credit cards electronically, virtually \\nanywhere. Wireless credit card processing is a very desirable system, because it allows \\nbusinesses to process t ransactions from mobile locations quickly, efficiently and \\nprofessionally. It is most often used by businesses that operate mainly in a mobile \\nenvironment \\n \\nThere is a system available from an Australian company \"Alacrity\" called closed -loop \\nenvironment for for wireless (CLEW). Figure above shows the flow of events with CLEW \\nwhich is a registered trademark of Alacrity used here only to demonstrate the flow in this \\nenvironment. \\n \\nAs shown in Figure, the basic flow is as follows: \\n1. Merchant sends a transaction to bank \\n2. The bank transmits the request to the authorized cardholder \\n3. The cardholder approves or rejects (password protected)'),\n",

The credit card transaction is completed. \\nSecurity Challenges Posed by Mobile Devices: \\nMobility brings two main challenges to cybersecurity: first, on the hand -held devices, \\ninformation is being taken outside the physically controlled environment and second remote \\naccess back to the protected environment is being granted. Perceptions of the organizations to \\nthese cybersecurity challenges are important in devising appropriate security operating \\nprocedure. When people are asked about important in managing a diverse range of mobile \\ndevices, they seem to be thinking of the ones shown in below figure. \\nAs the numb er of mobile device users increases, two challenges are presented: one at the \\ndevice level called \"micro challenges\" and another at the organizational level called \"macro -\\nchallenges.\" \\nSome well-known technical challenges in mobile security are: managing th e registry settings \\nand configurations, authentication service security, cryptography security, Lightweight \\nDirectory Access Protocol (LDAP) security, remote access server (RAS) security, media \\nplayer control security, networking application program interface (API), security etc. \\n \\nRegistry Settings for Mobile Devices: \\nLet us understand the issue of registry settings on mobile devices through an example: \\nMicrosoft Activesync is meant for synchronization with Windows -powered personal \\ncomputers (PCs) and Micr osoft Outlook. ActiveSync acts as the \"gateway between \\nWindows-powered PC and Windows mobile -powered device, enabling the transfer of \\napplications such as Outlook information, Microsoft Office documents, pictures, music, \\nvideos and applications from a user\\'s desktop to his/her device. \\nIn addition to synchronizing with a PC, ActiveSync can synchronize directly with the \\nMicrosoft exchange server so that the users can keep their E -Mails, calendar, notes and \\ncontacts updated wirelessly when they are away from t heir PCs. In this context, registry \\nsetting becomes an important issue given the ease with which various applications allow a \\nfree flow of information. \\n \\nAuthentication Service Security: \\nThere are two components of security in mobile computing: security of devices and security \\nin networks. A secure network access involves authentication between the device and the \\nbase stations or Web servers. This is to ensure that only authenticated devices can be'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 35 \\n \\nconnected to the network for obtaining the requested service s. No Malicious Code can \\nimpersonate the service provider to trick the device into doing something it does not mean to. \\nThus, the networks also play a crucial role in security of mobile devices. \\nSome eminent kinds of attacks to which mobile devices are sub jected to are: push attacks, \\npull attacks and crash attacks. \\nAuthentication services security is important given the typical attacks on mobile devices \\nthrough wireless networks: Dos attacks, traffic analysis, eavesdropping, man -in-the-middle \\nattacks and se ssion hijacking. Security measures in this scenario come from Wireless \\nApplication Protocols (WAPs), use of VPNs, media access control (MAC) address filtering \\nand development in 802.xx standards. \\nAttacks on Mobile-Cell Phones: \\n\\uf0b7 Mobile Phone Theft: \\nMobile phones have become an integral part of everbody\\'s life and the mobile phone has \\ntransformed from being a luxury to a bare necessity. Increase in the purchasing power and \\navailability of numerous low cost handsets have also lead to an increase in mobile phone  \\nusers. Theft of mobile phones has risen dramatically over the past few years. Since huge \\nsection of working population in India use public transport, major locations where theft \\noccurs are bus stops, railway stations and traffic signals.  \\nThe following factors contribute for outbreaks on mobile devices: \\n1. Enough target terminals: The first Palm OS virus was seen after the number of Palm \\nOS devices reached 15 million. The first instance of a mobile virus was observed during \\nJune 2004 when it was discovered  that an organization \"Ojam\" had engineered an \\nantipiracy Trojan virus in older versions of their mobile phone game known as Mosquito. \\nThis virus sent SMS text messages to the organization without the users\\' knowledge. \\n2. Enough functionality:  Mobile devic es are increasingly being equipped with office \\nfunctionality and already carry critical data and applications, which are often protected \\ninsufficiently or not at all. The expanded functionality also increases the probability of \\nmalware. \\n3. Enough connectiv ity: Smartphones offer multiple communication options, such as \\nSMS, MMS, synchronization, Bluetooth, infrared (IR) and WLAN connections. \\nTherefore, unfortunately, the increased amount of freedom also offers more choices for \\nvirus writers. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Mobile - Viruses \\n\\uf0b7  Concept of Mishing \\n\\uf0b7  Concept of Vishing \\n\\uf0b7 Concept of Smishing \\n\\uf0b7 Hacking - Bluetooth \\nOrganizational security Policies and Measures in Mobile Computing Era: \\nProliferation of hand -held devices used makes the cybersecurity issue graver than what we \\nwould tend to think. People have grown so used to their hand -helds they are treating them \\nlike wallets! For example, people are storing  more types of confidential information on \\nmobile computing devices than their employers or they themselves know; they listen to music \\nusing their -hand-held devices.One should think about not to keep credit card and bank'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 36 \\n \\naccount numbers, passwords, confide ntial E -Mails and strategic information about \\norganization, merger or takeover plans and also other valuable information that could impact \\nstock values in the mobile devices. Imagine the business impact if an employee\\'s USB, \\npluggable drive or laptop was l ost or stolen, revealing sensitive customer data such as credit \\nreports, social security numbers (SSNs) and contact information.  \\nOperating Guidelines for Implementing Mobile Device Security Policies \\nIn situations such as those described above, the ideal s olution would be to prohibit all \\nconfidential data from being stored on mobile devices, but this may not always be practical. \\nOrganizations can, however, reduce the risk that confidential information will be accessed \\nfrom lost or stolen mobile devices through the following steps: \\n1. Determine whether the employees in the organization need to use mobile computing \\ndevices at all, based on their risks and benefits within the organization, industry and \\nregulatory environment. \\n2. Implement additional security technologies, as appropriate to fit both the organization \\nand the types of devices used. Most (and perhaps all) mobile computing devices will \\nneed to have their native security augmented with such tools as strong encryption, \\ndevice passwords and physical locks. Bi ometrics techniques can be used for \\nauthentication and encryption and have great potential to eliminate the challenges \\nassociated with passwords. \\n3. Standardize the mobile computing devices and the associated security tools being \\nused with them. As a matter o f fundamental principle, security deteriorates quickly as \\nthe tools and devices used become increasingly disparate. \\n4. Develop a specific framework for using mobile computing devices, including \\nguidelines for data syncing, the use of firewalls and anti -malware software and the \\ntypes of information that can be stored on them. \\n5. Centralize management of your mobile computing devices. Maintain an inventory so \\nthat you know who is using what kinds of devices., \\n6. Establish patching procedures for software on mobile dev ices. This can often be \\nsimplified by integrating patching with syncing or patch management with the \\ncentralized  \\n7. Provide education and awareness training to personnel using mobile devices. People \\ncannot be expected to appropriately secure their information if they have not been told \\nhow. \\nOrganizational Policies for the Use of Mobile Hand-Held Devices \\nThere are many ways to handle the matter of creating policy for mobile devices. One way is \\ncreating distinct mobile computing policy. Another way is including  such devices existing \\npolicy. There are also approaches in between where mobile devices fall under both existing \\npolicies and a new one.In the hybrid approach, a new policy is created to address the specific \\nneeds of the mobile devices but more general usage issues fall under general IT policies. As a \\npart of this approach, the \"acceptable use\" policy for other technologies is extended to the \\nmobile devices.  \\nCompanies new to mobile devices may adopt an umbrella mobile policy but they find over \\ntime the the they will need to modify their policies to match the challenges posed by different \\nkinds of mobile hand -held devices. For example, wireless devices pose different challenges \\nthan non-wireless Also, employees who use mobile devices more than 20%%  of the time will \\nhave different requirements than less-frequent users. It may happen that over time, companies \\nmay need to create separate policies for the mobile devices on the basis of whether they \\nconnect wirelessly and with distinctions for devices that connect to WANs and LANs .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\CyChat\\\\CyChat\\\\data\\\\en\\\\Cyber Security-1.pdf'}, page_content='CYBER SECURITY Page 37 \\n \\nConcept of Laptops: \\nAs the price of computing technology is steadily decreasing, usage of devices such as the \\nlaptops is becoming more common. Although laptops, like other mobile devices, enhance the \\nbusiness functions owing to their mobile access to information anytime and anywhere, they \\nalso pose a large threat as they are portable Wireless capability in these devices has also \\nraised cyber security concerns owing to the information being transmitted over other, which \\nmakes it hard to detect. \\nThe thefts of laptops have always been a major issue, according to the cybersecurity industry \\nand insurance company statistics. Cybercriminals are targeting laptops that are expensive, to \\nenable them to fetch a quick profit in the black market. Ve ry few laptop. thieves. are actually \\ninterested in the information that is contained in the laptop. Most laptops contain personal \\nand corporate information that could be sensitive.. \\nPhysical Security Countermeasures \\nOrganizations are heavily dependent upon a mobile workforce with access to information, no \\nmatter where they travel. However, this mobility is putting organizations at risk of having a \\ndata breach if a laptop containing sensitive information is lost or stolen. Hence, physical \\nsecurity countermeasures are becoming very vital to protect the information on the employees \\nlaptops and to reduce the likelihood that employees will lose laptops.  \\n1. Cables and hardwired locks:  The most cost -efficient and ideal solution to safeguard any \\nmobile device is se curing with cables and locks, specially designed for laptops. Kensington \\ncables are one of the most popular brands in laptop security cable. These cables are made of \\naircraft-grade steel and Kevlar brand fiber, thus making these cables 40%%  stronger than any \\nother conventional security cables. One end of the security cable is fit into the universal \\nsecurity slot of the laptop and the other end is locked around any fixed furniture or item, thus \\nmaking a loop. These cables come with a variety of options such as number locks, key locks \\nand alarms. \\n \\n2. Laptop safes:  Safes made of polycarbonate - the same material that is used in bulletproof \\nwindows, police riot shields and bank security screens-can be used to carry and safeguard the \\nlaptops. The advantage of saf es over security cables is that they protect the whole laptop and \\nits devices such as CD -ROM bays, PCMCIA cards and HDD bays which can be easily \\nremoved in the case of laptops protected by security cables. \\n3. Motion sensors and alarms:  Even though alarms a nd motion sensors are annoying owing \\nto their false alarms and loud sound level, these devices are very efficient in securing laptops. \\nOnce these devices are activated, they can be used to track missing laptops in crowded \\nplaces. Also owing to their loud n ature, they help in deterring thieves. Modern systems for \\nlaptops are designed wherein the alarm device attached to the laptop transmits radio signals to \\na certain range around the laptop. \\n4. Warning labels and stamps:  Warning labels containing tracking in formation and \\nidentification details can be fixed onto the laptop to deter aspiring thieves. These labels \\ncannot be removed easily and are a low -cost solution to a laptop theft. These labels have an \\nidentification number that is stored in a universal datab ase for verification, which, in turn \\nmakes the resale of stolen laptops a difficult process. Such labels are highly recommended for \\nthe laptops issued to top executives and/or key employees of the organizations. \\n5. Other measures for protecting laptops are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Engraving the laptop with personal details \\n\\uf0b7 Keeping the laptop close to oneself wherever possible'),\n",
